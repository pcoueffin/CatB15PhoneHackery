# CatB15PhoneHackery Introduction

I've got a couple of Catepillar B15 phones to hack on.  They're an older Android phone, but fairly well ruggedized and water resistant.

Let's see what we can do with them.

# Things you can do in an android environment.

## Rooting the phone

[Docs on getting root access to the phone are here.](https://pcoueffin.github.io/CatB15PhoneHackery/rooting/)

## Installing Linux on Android

## Trying to compile LineageOS for it.

## Attempting to get OTG working

# Bare metal things

## Trying to boot Linux on the phone directly.

# Interesting hardware toys

## Bluetooth to serial bridge
